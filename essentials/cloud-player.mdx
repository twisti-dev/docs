## Get an Online Player by UUID or Name

```kotlin
val player = CloudPlayerManager.getPlayer("Notch") // or use an uuid

// or use the operator overload on CloudPlayer
val uuid = UUID.fromString("069a79f4-44e9-4726-a5be-fca90e38aaf5")
val other = CloudPlayer[uuid]
```

You can also convert a platform player that implements Kyori's `Audience` interface into a `CloudPlayer`:

```kotlin
val platformPlayer: Audience = ...;
val cloudPlayer: CloudPlayer? = platformPlayer.toCloudPlayer()
```

## AFK and Play Session

Check whether a player is AFK:

```kotlin
val isAfk: Boolean = player.isAfk()
```

You can also check how long the current player has been playing on their current server:

```kotlin
val sessionDuration: Duration = player.currentSessionDuration() // suspend
```

## Modify the Player PDC

While you can only read the PDC on an `OfflineCloudPlayer`, you can modify it on an online `CloudPlayer`:

```kotlin
val key = key("my-plugin", "some-data-key")
player.withPersistentData { // this: PersistentPlayerDataContainer â€” suspend 
  setBoolean(key, true)
}
```

## Check Connected Server

Sometimes you may want to check whether a player is in a server group or on a specific server:

```kotlin
val server: CloudServer = player.currentServer()
val onServer: Boolean = player.isOnServer(server)
val inGroup: Boolean = player.isInGroup(server.group)
```

## Disconnecting a player

You can disconnect a player normally with a message or silently without them noticing:

<CodeGroup>

```kotlin Normal
player.disconnect(buildText {
  // build disconnect message
  error("You have been kicked!")
})
```


```kotlin Silent
player.disconnectSilent()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Teleport a Player

You can teleport a player across the network:

<CodeGroup>

```kotlin Location
val success: Boolean = player.teleport(worldUuid, 100.0, 10.0, 200.0)
```


```kotlin Player
val target: CloudPlayer = ...;
val success: Boolean = player.teleport(target)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Check Permissions

You can also check whether a cloud player has specific permisison:

```kotlin
val state: Boolean = player.hasPermission("my.permission")
```

### Permission-Based Messages and Sounds

Sometimes you may want to send a message or play a sound only if the player has a specific permission. The `CloudPlayer` provides helper methods for that:

```kotlin
player.sendMessage(text("Message"), "some.permission")
player.playSound(sound {...}, Sound.Emitter.self(), "some.other.permission")
```
